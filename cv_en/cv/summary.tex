%With three years of experience, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several projects that allowed me to develop skills in cybersecurity, Linux integration and automation using Ansible. I’ve gained strong adaptability and a passion for automation. I’m constantly driven by curiosity and a strong desire to learn and explore new technologies. I am highly motivated by DevOps practices and continuously self-train on tools like Ansible, Kubernetes or Terraform.
I have developed a strong expertise in Linux integration and infrastructure automation using Ansible and Kubernetes. Driven by curiosity and a DevOps culture, I am now eager to apply my skills to large-scale scientific space projects. I am highly motivated to contribute to the ESA Datalabs evolution by leveraging Infrastructure as Code to support missions like Euclid and Planck.
